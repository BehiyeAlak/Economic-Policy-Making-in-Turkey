## Economic Policy Making in Turkey

#### The aim of the project is to identify major shifts in economic policy priorities in Turkey in the context of changing domestic and foreign economic conditions. We identify periods of economic policy and development in Turkey since 1996. We use RStudio in this project.

#### Tasks

##### 1) We read all annual programs by R from 1996 to 2020 available at https://www.sbb.gov.tr/yillik-programlar/ and convert the programs into a suitable data format. 
##### 2) We lean the data (remove formatting characters, like \n, remove hyphens, etc.).
##### 3) We identify major shifts in economic policy priorities by a simple text analysis. We specify certain policy concepts and calculate frequencies of certain concepts that reflect policy concerns.
##### 4) We download relevant Turkish economic variables from Central Bank of Republic of Turkey or international sources (World Bank, OECD, IMF, etc.).
##### 5) We identify relations between shifts in economic policies and economic conditions, and define periods of economic development and policy.
##### 6) We prepare a “web site” to present you results by Rmarkdown. We explain characteristics of different periods of economic development and policies in Turkey, i.e., anybody who read our site should understand major developments in the Turkish economy and policy responses since the mid 1990s.
