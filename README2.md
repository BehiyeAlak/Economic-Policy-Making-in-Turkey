#### To Whom It May Concern

#### If you want to run the rmarkdown file in your computer to get the html file, you need to:
-	Unzip the entire file to your R working directory
-	Run the R.project file
-	Run the “GroupB.rmd” rmarkdown file
-	Knit the file

#### If this does not work, you have to set working directory in the Rmarkdown file. This necessity of this process depends on the already set working directory and where you decide to unzip the file. If the file is unzipped to the already set working directory, it should work just fine.
